<!-- Exercise 6: Using a CSS icon set

Here, we'll learn how to integrate a font icon set. This is actually not really done
using much CSS at all (on your end), but the code is still useful to learn.

There are many icon sets out there, but two to try are Font Awesome and
Google's Material Design icons.

Font awesome: https://fontawesome.com/get-started/web-fonts-with-css
Google Material Design icons: http://google.github.io/material-design-icons/#icon-font-for-the-web

They have good instructions on both sites for how to set them up. We'll talk through it
briefly in class, but I'd like for you to try and decipher the instructions and
load them in yourself.

            You can size them however you'd like and apply colors using CSS. One idea might be to create a
            social media list and use the correct icons for each platform.
            Or, jut go wild and see what you can create. Frankly, jut getting them
            loaded and working would suffice.-->
