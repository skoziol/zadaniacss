<!-- Exercise 9: Frameworks, pt.1

Frameworks can be a fast way to implement things like styled forms, grid structures, and buttons. They also provide low-fuss ways to make sure images and elements are responsive.

However, they can also add to bloat of code and can lead to sites all looking the same.

In this exercise, the goal is to implement a framework (I recommend Bootstrap: https://getbootstrap.com).

1) Install Bootstrap (hint: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/)
2) Play with the built-in features (check out the documentation if you're not sure where to start: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/overview/). Some ideas:
    - try creating a responsive 3 column grid (see what happens at different breakpoints)
    - add some buttons
    - try making a fully responsive, scaling header image
    - set up a table and style it to include alternating colored rows
3) Set up your own custom, separate stylesheet for overrides (hint: https://bootstrapbay.com/blog/customize-bootstrap/)
    - try to take a "stock" element in Bootstrap and customize it
        - a button style
        - font sizing
        - table colors
