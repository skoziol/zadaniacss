# HTML/CSS Code Exercises


Hey everyone! Here is where our HTML/CSS exercises live for now. They are going to be broken into sections based on a range of coding tasks. You can download them all as a ZIP file, or go into each one and just cut and paste into your coding software (like Atom).

We'll take a look at everyone's code each week, answer questions, and talk about what we want to look at next. These will become increasingly complex (hopefully), so everyone should stay challenged. Thanks!
